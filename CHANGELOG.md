# Changelog

All notable changes to this template will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-03

### Changed

- Fewer permission prompts during the workflow: the bash permission hook now auto-approves more safe, read-only command shapes — including Vitest and quality-gate test runs and `sed -n '<range>p'` as a pipeline filter — while the deny rules were hardened so code-execution forms (`node -e`, `find -exec`, `npm install`, moving source files) still prompt by design.

### Added

- `journal.js` helper script that routes workflow decision-journal reads and writes through an auto-approved command, removing a recurring permission prompt at story commits and epic boundaries.

### Fixed

- Corrected the `vitest-axe` matcher import in the test-generator template (it used the old jest-axe API), which had caused generated accessibility tests to fail.

### Removed

- Unused `bcryptjs` / `@types/bcryptjs` dependency from the web template — password hashing happens in the backend under the BFF auth pattern, so the frontend never needs it. Trims the default install.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- `/migrate-legacy` command to upgrade a pre-4-phase `workflow-state.json` to the current INTAKE/PLAN/BUILD/COMPLETE model; `/continue` auto-routes to it when it detects a legacy state file.
- Backend API connectivity check during INTAKE — captures base URL, auth header, and environment variables, runs a smoke test, and saves a re-runnable `api-smoke-test.sh` plus connectivity config to the intake manifest for BUILD to treat as authoritative.
- `/api-status`, `/api-go-live`, and `/api-mock-refresh` commands for managing the switch between mock and live API backends, with `/api-go-live` gated on a passing smoke test.
- Deployment guide covering how to ship the generated application.
- Requirements traceability matrix and coverage tracking across stories.
- Compliance and regulatory screening surfaced as a blocking question during INTAKE.
- Testing-strategy overhaul: an INTAKE probe for available test tooling, coverage tags, a manual-test gate at each epic boundary, and a hard stop when an endpoint would be invented rather than specified.
- `/continue` can now extend an already-completed feature with new epics.
- Publish pipeline that mirrors each GitHub release into the public release repository.

### Changed

- **Workflow simplification:** collapsed the 9-phase model (INTAKE / DESIGN / SCOPE / STORIES / REALIGN / TEST-DESIGN / WRITE-TESTS / IMPLEMENT / QA) into 4 phases (INTAKE / PLAN / BUILD / COMPLETE) with 1–2 user gates and an agent-driven BUILD loop. See `.claude/WORKFLOWS.md`.
- INTAKE produces a single `project-brief.md` artifact (replaces the FRS / assumptions split).
- BUILD agents apply a four-tier autonomy policy (`agent-autonomy.md`) and halt only for genuinely unsafe ground.
- `/start` now chains directly into `/continue` after Gate 1 — no `/clear` boundaries anywhere in the flow, and setup is inlined into `/start`.
- Subagents are tiered by model — Opus for planning and coding, Sonnet for most agents, Haiku for mechanical generators.
- Template sync now uses a personal access token and runs manual-only, opening a self-healing "action required" issue when it can't run.
- Template documentation reorganized into separate `users/` and `template-maintainers/` folders and rewritten in plain language for non-developer users.
- Authentication follows a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern, replacing the client-side NextAuth/RBAC scaffold.

### Removed

- Agents `intake-brd-review-agent`, `design-wireframe-agent`, `design-roles-agent`, `prototype-review-agent`, `spec-compliance-watchdog`, `test-designer` — folded into `intake-agent`, `test-generator`, or eliminated.
- Per-story Markdown files; story metadata now lives in `workflow-state.json` with a per-epic overview file for visibility.
- The `/setup` command (folded into `/start`) and the NextAuth/RBAC scaffold (replaced by the BFF auth pattern).

### Fixed

- Numerous permission-hook fixes so routine read-only and QA commands are auto-approved (quoted paths with spaces, git global options, multi-path/glob reads, and subshell pipelines).
- Lighthouse performance gate no longer fails with a Chrome interstitial error in CI (defaults to mock-API mode).
- Resolved npm audit vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### Security

- Authentication moved server-side via the BFF pattern, replacing the client-side RBAC scaffold.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-25

Released without a curated changelog entry. See the
[v0.3.0 release notes](https://github.com/stadium-software/stadium-8/releases/tag/v0.3.0)
and the git history for details.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- `/status` command with visual workflow progress indicators showing current phase and completed steps
- `/continue` command for resuming interrupted TDD workflows with automatic state detection
- Design Wireframe agent for creating wireframes before story planning
- `/start` command now executes TDD workflow one epic at a time (Plan → Test → Implement → Review → Verify → Commit/PR per epic)
- Performance gate (Gate 5) with Lighthouse CI integration
- PR comment reporting for all quality gates (Security, Code Quality, Testing, Performance)
- Security scanning for hardcoded secrets (API keys, AWS keys, tokens) in PR checks
- Template update sync system with weekly workflow for receiving upstream changes
- Auto-fix step in quality-gate-checker (runs lint:fix, format, audit fix before reporting failures)
- Plain-language error explanations in quality-gate-checker for non-developer users
- Workflow state tracking to all agents for `/status` visibility
- Session logging now works in both CLI and VSCode extension

### Changed

- Quality gates now enforce strict binary pass/fail (no conditional passes or rationalized failures)
- Agents must present actual status and options to user instead of auto-approving failures
- Improved non-developer user experience with clearer documentation and error messages

### Fixed

- Ensure linting and tests are run before submitting story PRs
- Ensure design-wireframe-agent commits wireframes to prevent data loss
- Exclude bcrypt hashes from hardcoded secrets scan (false positives)
- Add detailed tracing to hardcoded secrets scan for debugging
- Run npm audit fix for dependency security updates
- Remove unused tasks folder

### Security

- Enhanced PR quality gates with regex scanning for hardcoded secrets
- PR comments now report security scan results
